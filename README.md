# Cartoonizer-with-AI-Segmenter
AI-Segmented Cartoonizer. Can be used with your own segmenter. I dunno why I wrote segmentator to the title and I have no idea how to change it now.

# How to use?
0-) Install packages with pip
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1-) Initialize class with either a segmenter or a string "Human" to use automatically mediapipe selfie segmentation.

2-) Call run function with an image or an image path.
```
Note: In case of string input, I didn't check if its a path or not. 
If it's a string but not a path, program will crash.
```

3-) Use it?

# Why did I do this?
I thought it will be cool but it wasn't. Who could have knew that cv2 has a built in function for it? 

But the main reason behind this project was learning how to use github and it's already in github now so I won't take it down back.
